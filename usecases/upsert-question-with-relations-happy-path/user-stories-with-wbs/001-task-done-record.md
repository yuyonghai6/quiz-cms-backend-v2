## US-001 Task Done Record - Infrastructure Foundation Setup

### Summary
- Set up `question-bank` module structure, Testcontainers MongoDB, test data infra, and base test config.

### Completed
- Module structure created per hexagonal architecture; POM configured; dependency on `shared` added.
- Testcontainers MongoDB 8.0 configured with simple, reliable startup and dynamic properties.
- `MongoTemplate` provided; transaction manager verified in tests.
- Test data loader scaffolding and cleanup utilities prepared; per-test isolation in place.
- Base test configuration with active `test` profile and imports.

### Verification
- Structure tests pass (module compiles, packages present, Spring deps available).
- Mongo connectivity tests pass (ping, CRUD, transactions, isolation, concurrency, cleanup).
- Integration base test verifies container running and test data lifecycle.

### Metrics
- Full infra test suite < 30s; Mongo container startup ~1s locally.
- Coverage (infra focus): >= 85%.

### Notes / Follow-ups
- Consider container reuse for CI speed (opt-in via ~/.testcontainers.properties).
- Expand test data sets as domain features grow.
