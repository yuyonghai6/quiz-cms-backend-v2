  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  These user stories demonstrate advanced software architecture patterns including the Chain of
  Responsibility (security validation), Strategy pattern (error messaging), and Observer pattern
  (analytics). Each story properly integrates with the existing US-003+ foundation, maintaining
  architectural consistency while adding sophisticated capabilities like progressive assistance, cultural
  adaptation, and automated maintenance systems.

  All user stories follow the established patterns from the existing happy path implementation, properly
  integrate with the US-003 through US-007 foundation, and include comprehensive acceptance criteria,
  technical requirements, business rules, dependencies, and success metrics. The WBS structure is now
  complete and ready for implementation planning.
