# test code about using testcontainer mongodb, not using localhost:27017
note: this project use testcontainer mongodb, in order to ease CICD pipeline,I don't have mongodb setup with docker compose or any existing mongodb, only testcontainer mongoDB so far, so if you write test related to mongodb connection, please be careful to use the proper mongodb connection to testcontainer mongodb only. you should not use localhost:27017 in your test code for mongodb connection
