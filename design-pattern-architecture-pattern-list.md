## 2. CQRS and Messaging Patterns

### 2.1 Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
**Implementation**: Physical module separation with dedicated command and query modules
**Business Purpose**: Optimizes read and write operations independently, enabling different scaling strategies

**Architecture Details**:
- **Command Side** (`internal-layer/question-bank`):
  - Handles all write operations (create, update, delete)
  - Contains domain aggregates, business logic, and validation
  - Enforces business rules through domain entities and value objects
  - Uses MongoDB with transaction support for consistency
  - Command handlers implement `ICommandHandler<C, T>`
  - Package: `com.quizfun.questionbank`

- **Query Side** (`internal-layer/question-bank-query`):
  - Handles all read operations with optimized read models
  - Separate from domain models for independent optimization
  - Uses MongoDB aggregation pipelines for complex queries
  - Specialized indexes for query performance
  - Query handlers implement `IQueryHandler<Q, T>`
  - Package: `com.quizfun.questionbankquery`

- **Mediator Integration**:
  - Both modules register handlers via Spring's component scanning
  - Mediator routes commands to question-bank handlers
  - Mediator routes queries to question-bank-query handlers
  - Type-safe routing using reflection-based generic type extraction

**Benefits**:
- Independent scaling of read vs write workloads
- Different optimization strategies per side (e.g., denormalization for reads)
- Clear separation of concerns between state changes and data retrieval
- Prevents read model complexity from affecting write model simplicity

**File References**:
- `usecases/upsert-question-with-relations-happy-path/user-stories-with-wbs/008.cqrs-command-handler-implementation.md`
- `usecases/upsert-question-with-relations-happy-path/1.architecture-overview-for-this-usecase.md`
- Module: `internal-layer/question-bank` (command handlers)
- Module: `internal-layer/question-bank-query` (query handlers)

- `usecases/upsert-question-with-relations-happy-path/user-stories-with-wbs/008.cqrs-command-handler-implementation.md`

### 2.3 Command Pattern
**Implementation**: Encapsulates requests as objects

- `usecases/upsert-question-with-relations-happy-path/user-stories-with-wbs/007.application-service-integration.md`

### 2.5 Query Pattern
**Implementation**: Read-only data retrieval operations in dedicated query module
**Business Purpose**: Optimizes data access for specific views with specialized read models

**Implementation Details**:
- **Query Objects**: Implement `IQuery<T>` interface from mediator pattern
  - Example: `QueryQuestions` encapsulates filter, pagination, and sorting parameters
  - Immutable query objects ensure thread-safety

- **Query Handlers**: Implement `IQueryHandler<Q, T>` in `question-bank-query` module
  - Auto-registered with mediator via Spring component scanning
  - Delegates to application services for business logic
  - Returns `Result<T>` for consistent error handling

- **Optimized Read Models**:
  - MongoDB aggregation pipelines for complex joins (questions with taxonomies)
  - Specialized indexes configured in `MongoQueryIndexConfig`
  - Text search indexes for full-text question search
  - Compound indexes for filtering and sorting

- **Query Repository Layer**:
  - `IQuestionQueryRepository`: Port interface for query operations
  - `MongoQuestionQueryRepository`: MongoDB-specific implementation
  - `QuestionQueryAggregationBuilder`: Builder for complex aggregation pipelines
  - Separate from command-side repositories for independent optimization

**File References**:
- `usecases/upsert-question-with-relations-happy-path/user-stories-with-wbs/000.shared-module-infrastructure-setup.md`
- `usecases/upsert-question-with-relations-happy-path/user-stories-with-wbs/008.cqrs-command-handler-implementation.md`

### 2.7 Read Model Pattern
**Implementation**: Optimized read-only data structures in query module
**Business Purpose**: Provides denormalized, query-optimized views of data independent from write models

**Pattern Details**:
- **Separation from Write Models**:
  - Command side uses rich domain aggregates for enforcing business rules
  - Query side uses flat DTOs optimized for data retrieval and presentation
  - No shared model objects between command and query modules

- **Read Model Characteristics**:
  - **QuestionDTO**: Flattened question representation with embedded taxonomy data
  - **TaxonomyDTO**: Denormalized taxonomy information for quick access
  - **PaginationMetadata**: Enriched pagination with total count, page info
  - Pre-joined data to avoid N+1 queries in presentation layer

- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - MongoDB aggregation with `$lookup` for joining questions and taxonomies
  - Projection pipelines to select only required fields
  - Index-backed sorting and filtering
  - Text indexes for full-text search capabilities
  - Result set limiting and pagination at database level

- **Infrastructure Support**:
  - `QuestionDocument`: MongoDB-specific document model for queries
  - `QuestionDocumentMapper`: Maps documents to DTOs
  - `QuestionQueryAggregationBuilder`: Builds complex MongoDB aggregations
  - `MongoQueryIndexConfig`: Configures indexes optimized for read patterns

**Benefits**:
- Read models can evolve independently from domain models
- Queries don't pay the cost of lazy loading or complex object graphs
- Can use different denormalization strategies per query type
- Enables caching strategies without affecting write-side consistency

**File References**:
- Module: `internal-layer/question-bank-query`
- Package: `com.quizfun.questionbankquery.application.dto` (read model DTOs)
- Class: `QuestionDocument.java` (query-optimized document model)
