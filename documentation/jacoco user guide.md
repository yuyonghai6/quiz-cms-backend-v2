# JaCoCo Test Coverage User Guide

This guide explains how to generate, view, and interpret JaCoCo test coverage reports in this Maven multi-module Spring Boot project.

## Quick Start

### Generate Coverage Reports
```bash
# Generate coverage reports for all modules
mvn clean test

# Generate coverage for specific modules only
mvn clean test -pl global-shared-library,internal-layer/shared
```

### View Coverage Reports
After running tests, open these HTML files in your browser:
- **Global Shared Library**: `global-shared-library/target/site/jacoco/index.html`
- **Internal Layer Shared**: `internal-layer/shared/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

## Available Commands

### Basic Coverage Generation
```bash
# Clean build and generate coverage reports
mvn clean test

# Generate coverage without cleaning (faster for iterative development)
mvn test
```

### Coverage Validation
```bash
# Check if coverage meets the 70% threshold (fails build if below)
mvn jacoco:check

# Check coverage for specific modules
mvn jacoco:check -pl global-shared-library,internal-layer/shared

# Run full verification (includes coverage check)
mvn verify
```

### Advanced Coverage Commands
```bash
# Generate coverage reports without running tests (if tests already ran)
mvn jacoco:report

# Generate coverage for integration tests (when available)
mvn verify

# Clean old coverage data before new test run
rm -rf target/jacoco.exec target/site/jacoco/
```

## Understanding Coverage Reports

### HTML Report Structure
When you open `target/site/jacoco/index.html`, you'll see:

1. **Overview Page**: Summary of all packages with coverage percentages
2. **Package Drill-down**: Click package names to see class-level coverage
3. **Class Drill-down**: Click class names to see method and line coverage
4. **Source View**: See exactly which lines are covered (green) or missed (red)

### Coverage Metrics Explained
- **Instructions**: JVM bytecode instructions covered/total
- **Branches**: Conditional branches (if/else, switch) covered/total
- **Lines**: Source code lines covered/total
- **Methods**: Methods invoked during tests/total methods
- **Classes**: Classes with at least one method executed/total classes

### Color Coding
- üü¢ **Green**: Fully covered code
- üî¥ **Red**: Not covered code
- üü° **Yellow**: Partially covered branches (some conditions not tested)

## Coverage Thresholds

### Current Project Settings
- **Minimum Line Coverage**: 70%
- **Enforcement**: Build fails if coverage drops below threshold
- **Scope**: Applied per module (bundle)

### Coverage Status by Module
```
üìä Module Coverage Status:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ global-shared-library: 64% (‚ö†Ô∏è Below threshold)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal-layer/shared: Active coverage tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestration-layer: No tests currently
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ question-bank: No tests currently
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ quiz-session: No tests currently
```

## Report Locations

### Generated Files Structure
```
module-name/target/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jacoco.exec                    # Execution data (binary)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ site/jacoco/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html                 # Main HTML report
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jacoco.xml                 # XML format (for CI/CD)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jacoco.csv                 # CSV format (for analysis)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jacoco-sessions.html       # Session information
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ com.quizfun.package/       # Package-specific reports
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ClassName.html
```

### Direct File Access
Open coverage reports directly:
```bash
# Global Shared Library
open global-shared-library/target/site/jacoco/index.html

# Internal Layer Shared
open internal-layer/shared/target/site/jacoco/index.html

# Or use file:// URLs in browser
file:///absolute/path/to/project/global-shared-library/target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Coverage Data Generated
**Problem**: "Skipping JaCoCo execution due to missing execution data file"

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure tests are actually running: `mvn test -X` (debug mode)
2. Check if module has tests: `find . -name "*Test.java"`
3. Verify JaCoCo plugin is enabled in module's `pom.xml`

### Coverage Reports Not Updated
**Problem**: Old coverage data showing after code changes

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Clean before generating new reports
mvn clean test

# Or manually remove old data
rm -rf */target/jacoco.exec */target/site/jacoco/
```

### Build Fails Due to Coverage
**Problem**: "Coverage checks have not been met"

**Solutions**:
1. **Add more tests** to increase coverage
2. **Skip coverage check temporarily**:
   ```bash
   mvn test -Djacoco.skip=true
   ```
3. **Lower threshold temporarily** (not recommended for production)

### Multiple JaCoCo Plugin Declaration Warning
**Problem**: "'build.plugins.plugin.(groupId:artifactId)' must be unique"

**Status**: Known issue in orchestration-layer module, doesn't affect functionality

## Integration with CI/CD

### XML Reports for Build Systems
JaCoCo generates XML reports at `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml` for integration with:
- SonarQube
- CodeCov
- GitHub Actions
- Jenkins

### CSV Reports for Analysis
CSV reports at `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv` can be imported into:
- Excel/Google Sheets
- Data analysis tools
- Custom reporting scripts

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **Write tests first** (TDD approach)
2. **Run coverage frequently**: `mvn test`
3. **Aim for meaningful coverage**, not just high percentages
4. **Focus on critical business logic** first
5. **Review uncovered branches** in HTML reports

### Coverage Targets
- **New code**: Aim for 80%+ coverage
- **Legacy code**: Gradual improvement, 70% minimum
- **Critical paths**: 90%+ coverage preferred
- **Simple getters/setters**: Lower priority

### Monitoring Coverage Trends
```bash
# Generate trend reports by comparing coverage over time
mvn clean test && cp target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml coverage-$(date +%Y%m%d).xml
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Module-Specific Coverage Settings
To customize coverage for specific modules, add to module's `pom.xml`:
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
    <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <rules>
            <rule>
                <element>BUNDLE</element>
                <limits>
                    <limit>
                        <counter>LINE</counter>
                        <value>COVEREDRATIO</value>
                        <minimum>0.80</minimum> <!-- 80% for this module -->
                    </limit>
                </limits>
            </rule>
        </rules>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### Excluding Classes from Coverage
```xml
<configuration>
    <excludes>
        <exclude>**/*Config.class</exclude>
        <exclude>**/*Application.class</exclude>
    </excludes>
</configuration>
```

## Summary
