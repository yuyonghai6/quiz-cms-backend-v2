★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  We've successfully implemented a comprehensive validation chain following the Chain of Responsibility pattern with sophisticated error
  handling, retry mechanisms, and performance monitoring. The implementation demonstrates several key architectural patterns: CQRS command
  structure, defensive programming through immutable DTOs, fail-fast validation with detailed error reporting, and clean separation of
  concerns between infrastructure utilities and domain validation logic.

  The retry helper with exponential backoff ensures resilience against temporary failures while properly distinguishing between retryable
  (network/infrastructure) and non-retryable (authorization/validation) errors, which is crucial for production systems.

  ✅ US-003: Validation Chain Implementation - COMPLETED

  What We Implemented:

  Core Infrastructure:
  - ✅ UpsertQuestionCommand with sophisticated taxonomy extraction and immutability
  - ✅ ValidationErrorCode enumeration for consistent error handling
  - ✅ DTOs (UpsertQuestionRequestDto, TaxonomyData, QuestionResponseDto) with builder pattern
  - ✅ Repository interfaces for ownership and taxonomy validation

  Validation Chain:
  - ✅ QuestionBankOwnershipValidator with retry mechanism and security logging
  - ✅ TaxonomyReferenceValidator with bulk reference validation
  - ✅ QuestionDataIntegrityValidator with comprehensive business rules
  - ✅ ValidationChainConfig Spring configuration with multiple chain types

  Supporting Infrastructure:
  - ✅ RetryHelper utility with exponential backoff and smart retry logic
  - ✅ ValidationChainMetrics for performance monitoring and debugging

  Comprehensive Tests:
  - ✅ Unit tests for UpsertQuestionCommand with Allure annotations
  - ✅ Unit tests for QuestionBankOwnershipValidator with Mockito
  - ✅ Integration tests for complete validation chain execution
  - ✅ Concurrency tests for thread safety verification

  Key Features:

  1. Security-First Design: Ownership validation runs first with comprehensive logging
  2. Fail-Fast Behavior: Chain stops at first validation failure with detailed error messages
  3. Resilience: Retry mechanism handles temporary infrastructure failures
  4. Performance: Optimized validation order and monitoring capabilities
  5. Testability: Comprehensive test coverage with realistic scenarios
  6. Maintainability: Clean separation of concerns and extensible design

  The validation chain is now ready for integration with the CQRS command handler in the next user story. All tests pass, the code compiles
  successfully, and follows the established patterns in your Spring Boot architecture.
