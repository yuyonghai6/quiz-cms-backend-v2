# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Architecture

This is a Maven multi-module Spring Boot project with a layered architecture:

- **Root module** (`maven-submodule-base`): Parent POM that manages dependencies and plugins
- **orchestration-layer**: Spring Boot application module with web and security dependencies
- **internal-layer**: Internal business logic module with sub-modules:
  - `question-bank`: Question management functionality
  - `quiz-session`: Quiz session management functionality
- **external-service-proxy**: External service integration module
- **global-shared-library**: Shared utilities and mediator pattern implementation

The project uses Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.5.6 with dependency management centralized in the parent POM.

## Common Commands

### Build Commands
```bash
# Build entire project (from root)
mvn clean compile

# Build specific module
mvn clean compile -pl orchestration-layer

# Package all modules
mvn clean package

# Install to local repository
mvn clean install
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Run the main Spring Boot application
mvn spring-boot:run -pl orchestration-layer

# Alternative using Maven wrapper (if available)
./orchestration-layer/mvnw spring-boot:run

# Run with specific profile
mvn spring-boot:run -pl orchestration-layer -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run tests for specific module
mvn test -pl orchestration-layer

# Run integration tests (uses Testcontainers)
mvn verify -pl orchestration-layer

# Generate and check coverage reports
mvn verify

# Run coverage check only (fails if below 70%)
mvn jacoco:check
```

### Allure Reporting
```bash
# Run tests and generate Allure results
mvn clean test

# Generate Allure report and open in browser automatically
mvn allure:serve

# Generate static HTML report (for CI/CD or sharing)
mvn allure:report

# View static HTML report
open target/allure-report/index.html

# Clean old results before new test run (recommended)
rm -rf target/allure-results
```

## Development Notes

- The `orchestration-layer` is the main runnable Spring Boot application (runs on port 8080 by default)
- Other modules are libraries that can be dependencies of the orchestration layer
- Lombok is configured for annotation processing in the orchestration layer
- Testcontainers is set up for integration testing
- Spring Security is enabled in the orchestration layer
- Reference projects are available in `reference-projects/` for MongoDB Testcontainer examples

## Cross-Module Development

### Component Scanning Configuration
The orchestration layer is configured with cross-module component scanning:
```java
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {
    "com.quizfun.orchestrationlayer",
    "com.quizfun.internallayer",
    "com.quizfun.globalshared"
})
```
This enables Spring dependency injection across modules. When adding new modules that contain Spring components, update the `scanBasePackages` array.

### Module Dependencies
- `internal-layer`: Contains Spring Boot starter, provides business logic services with question-bank and quiz-session sub-modules
- `external-service-proxy`: Currently minimal, intended for external service integrations
- `global-shared-library`: Shared utilities and mediator pattern implementation
- `orchestration-layer`: Main application with web, security, and dependencies on internal-layer and global-shared-library

### Adding New Services Across Modules
1. Create service in target module with `@Service` annotation
2. Add module dependency in orchestration-layer's pom.xml
3. Update `scanBasePackages` if new module package root is different
4. Use constructor injection with `@Autowired` in orchestration layer

### Compiler Configuration
The orchestration layer has `-parameters` enabled for proper `@RequestParam` binding without explicit `name` attributes.

## Mediator Pattern Architecture

The project implements a CQRS-style mediator pattern in the `global-shared-library` module:

### Core Components
- **IMediator**: Central interface for sending commands (`send(ICommand<T> command)`) and queries (`send(IQuery<T> query)`)
- **ICommand<T>**: Marker interface for commands that return type T
- **ICommandHandler<C, T>**: Handles commands of type C and returns Result<T>
- **IQuery<T>**: Marker interface for queries that return type T
- **IQueryHandler<Q, T>**: Handles queries of type Q and returns Result<T>
- **Result<T>**: Wrapper for success/failure responses with error handling
- **MediatorImpl**: Spring service that auto-registers handlers via reflection

### Handler Registration
The mediator automatically discovers and registers all `@Service` beans implementing `ICommandHandler` and `IQueryHandler` using Spring's `ApplicationContext`. Handler registration uses reflection to extract generic type parameters, enabling type-safe command and query routing.

### Usage Patterns
**Commands (for operations that modify state):**
1. Create command class implementing `ICommand<ReturnType>`
2. Create handler class implementing `ICommandHandler<YourCommand, ReturnType>` with `@Service`
3. Inject `IMediator` and call `mediator.send(command)`

**Queries (for read-only operations):**
1. Create query class implementing `IQuery<ReturnType>`
2. Create handler class implementing `IQueryHandler<YourQuery, ReturnType>` with `@Service`
3. Inject `IMediator` and call `mediator.send(query)`

## Documentation and Examples

### Cross-Module Integration Guide
The repository includes comprehensive documentation on creating services across modules:
- See `documentation/how to create a service in internal layer service submodule and being called from orchestration layer.md` for step-by-step cross-module service creation
- Reference implementation examples available in `reference-projects/try-mongo-testcontainer/`

### Coverage and Quality

The project enforces **70% line coverage** using JaCoCo across all modules. Coverage reports are generated during the `test` phase and validated during `verify`. All modules inherit JaCoCo configuration from the parent POM.

## Testing and Reporting

### Allure Integration
The project is fully configured with Allure 2.25.0 for comprehensive test reporting. All 37 test methods across 8 test classes have been annotated with the proper Allure hierarchy:

**Current Test Organization:**
- **Epic**: "Core Infrastructure" (applied to all test classes)
- **Feature**: "Main Path" (applied to all test classes)
- **Story**: "000.shared-module-infrastructure-setup" (applied to all test methods)
- **@DisplayName**: Human-readable test descriptions

**Report Structure:**
```
üìä Epic: Core Infrastructure
  ‚îî‚îÄ üìÅ Feature: Main Path
      ‚îî‚îÄ üìñ Story: 000.shared-module-infrastructure-setup
          ‚îú‚îÄ ‚úÖ Should add domain event to uncommitted events
          ‚îú‚îÄ ‚úÖ Should successfully execute command with registered handler
          ‚îú‚îÄ ‚úÖ Should create successful result with value
          ‚îî‚îÄ ... (all 37 test methods)
```

- **Suite Hierarchy**: View by package/class structure
- **Overview Tab**: Statistics, pass rates, trends, timeline

See `documentation/step by step guide allure spring boot.md` for complete setup details.

### Domain-Driven Design Elements
The `internal-layer/shared` module provides foundational DDD building blocks:
- `AggregateRoot`: Base class for aggregate roots
- `DomainEvent` and `BaseDomainEvent`: Domain event infrastructure
- `Result<T>`: Functional result wrapper for error handling
- `ValidationHandler`: Centralized validation logic

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
