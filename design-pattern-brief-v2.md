## 1. Architectural Styles

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
The foundational architectural style organizing business logic around the domain model.

**Core Patterns:**
- **Aggregate Root**: Transaction boundaries with `QuestionAggregate`, `QuestionBanksPerUserAggregate`, `TaxonomySetAggregate`
- **Bounded Context**: Module separation (`question-bank`, `question-bank-query`, `shared`) with clear boundaries
- **Domain Events**: Event-driven communication (`QuestionCreatedEvent`, `QuestionUpdatedEvent`)
- **Entity Pattern**: Identity-based lifecycle management for domain objects
- **Value Objects**: Type-specific immutable domain concepts (QuestionType, DifficultyLevel, McqData, EssayData)
- **Specification Pattern**: Reusable business rules and query criteria

**Business Impact**: Clean domain model isolation, reduced coupling, improved maintainability

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Physical module separation for read and write operations with independent scaling strategies.

**Architecture:**
- **Command Side** (`question-bank` module):
  - Write operations with domain aggregates and business logic
  - MongoDB transactions for consistency
  - Command handlers: `ICommandHandler<C, T>`

- **Query Side** (`question-bank-query` module):
  - Optimized read models with denormalization
  - MongoDB aggregation pipelines and specialized indexes
  - Query handlers: `IQueryHandler<Q, T>`

**Benefits:**
- Independent scaling of read vs write workloads
- Different optimization strategies per side
- Read model complexity doesn't affect write model simplicity

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
Clean architecture with dependency inversion isolating business logic from infrastructure.

**Structure:**
- **Application Layer**: Commands, DTOs, ports (interfaces), services, validation
- **Domain Layer**: Aggregates, entities, value objects, domain services, events
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Persistence (MongoDB documents, repositories), configuration, mappers

**Benefits**: Framework independence, testability, infrastructure substitution without domain changes

---

## 2. Architectural Patterns

### Messaging & Coordination

**Mediator Pattern**
- Central command/query routing via `IMediator`
- Auto-registration of handlers via Spring reflection
- Type-safe routing: commands → command-handlers, queries → query-handlers
- Decouples controllers from business logic

**Command Pattern**
- Immutable request encapsulation (`UpsertQuestionCommand`, `OnNewUserCreateDefaultQuestionBankCommand`)
- Enables queuing, logging, audit trails
- Command handlers provide single responsibility processing

**Query Pattern**
- Read-only operations in dedicated query module
- Immutable query objects (`QueryQuestions`) with filters, pagination, sorting
- Optimized with MongoDB aggregation pipelines and indexes

**Read Model Pattern**
- Denormalized DTOs (`QuestionDTO`, `TaxonomyDTO`, `PaginationMetadata`)
- Pre-joined data avoiding N+1 queries
- Independent evolution from domain models
- MongoDB `$lookup` aggregations with index-backed filtering

### Data Access

**Repository Pattern**
- Clean persistence abstraction with ports/adapters
- Command-side: Domain aggregate persistence with transactions
- Query-side: Optimized read repositories with aggregations (`MongoQuestionQueryRepository`)
- Separate implementations for command and query concerns

**Data Mapper Pattern**
- Bidirectional mapping between domain aggregates and MongoDB documents
- `QuestionDocumentMapper` for query-side transformations
- Keeps domain layer free from persistence concerns

### Domain Logic

**Factory Pattern**
- Domain object creation (`QuestionTypeStrategyFactory`)
- Runtime strategy selection based on question type
- Encapsulates complex instantiation logic

**Observer Pattern**
- Domain event notifications for aggregate state changes
- Security monitoring and audit logging integration
- Enables event-driven architecture and loose coupling

---

## 3. Design Patterns

### Behavioral Patterns

**Strategy Pattern**
- Question type-specific processing (MCQ, Essay, TrueFalse)
- Common interface (`IQuestionTypeStrategy`) with specialized implementations
- Runtime behavior selection via factory

**Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
- Sequential validation pipeline with fail-fast
- Validators: security context → ownership → taxonomy → type-specific
- Each validator can short-circuit on failure

**Template Method Pattern**
- Common validation algorithm skeleton
- Subclass-specific implementation of validation steps
- Consistent validation flow across question types

**State Pattern**
- Question lifecycle and status management
- Behavior changes based on question state (draft, published, archived)

**Iterator Pattern**
- Collection traversal for validation and aggregate processing
- Uniform access to taxonomy collections and question lists

**Visitor Pattern**
- Type-specific validation and processing
- Adds operations without modifying question type structures

### Structural Patterns

**Adapter Pattern**
- Infrastructure-to-domain integration
- MongoDB documents adapted to domain aggregates
- HTTP requests adapted to application commands/queries

**Facade Pattern**
- Application service coordination (`DefaultQuestionBankApplicationService`)
- Simplified interface to complex validation chains, strategies, and repositories
- Orchestrates multi-step business operations

**Decorator Pattern**
- Enhanced validation layers wrapping base validators
- Dynamic behavior addition to validation chain

**Proxy Pattern**
- Repository interfaces controlling data access
- Security validation proxies for authorization
- Lazy loading and access control

**Builder Pattern**
- Complex object construction with fluent interface
- MongoDB aggregation pipeline building (`QuestionQueryAggregationBuilder`)
- Test data builders for reliable test isolation

### Creational Patterns

**Dependency Injection Pattern**
- Constructor-based injection throughout all layers
- Spring-managed lifecycle and configuration
- Enables loose coupling and comprehensive testability

- Explicit success/failure with `Result<T>`
- Type-safe error propagation throughout all layers

**Error Collection Pattern**
- Aggregates multiple validation errors
- Comprehensive feedback in single response
- Improves developer experience with complete error context

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- Resilience against service failures
- Prevents cascade failures in distributed operations
- Fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation

**Retry Pattern**
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Handles transient failures (network, database)

---

## 6. Integration Patterns

**RESTful API Pattern**
- HTTP API with standard status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- Resource-oriented design (`/api/users/{userId}/question-banks/{questionBankId}/questions`)
- Content negotiation and proper HTTP verbs

**Data Transfer Object (DTO) Pattern**
- Clean HTTP-application layer contracts
- Request DTOs: `UpsertQuestionRequestDto`, `QueryQuestionsRequest`
- Response DTOs: `QuestionResponseDto`, `QueryQuestionsResponse`
- Validation annotations for input sanitization

**Transaction Script Pattern**
- ACID transaction management across MongoDB operations

- `@Transactional` for rollback support

**Request-Response Pattern**
- Structured communication between layers
- Standardized message formats
- Consistent error and success response structures
