# US-024: Session Hijacking Detection System

## User Story
**As a** system security administrator
**I want** automatic detection of session hijacking attempts through behavioral analysis
**So that** stolen or intercepted authentication tokens cannot be used to access user accounts

## Epic
Security Breach Protection

## Story
Implement session security validation with IP consistency, User-Agent verification, and concurrent session monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

### Session Integrity Validation
- [ ] **AC-024.1**: IP address consistency must be validated against session creation IP
- [ ] **AC-024.2**: User-Agent string must be validated for consistency throughout session
- [ ] **AC-024.3**: Concurrent sessions from different locations must be detected and flagged
- [ ] **AC-024.4**: Geolocation anomalies must trigger additional verification requirements

### Behavioral Analysis
- [ ] **AC-024.5**: Unusual access patterns must be detected and logged
- [ ] **AC-024.6**: Session activity timeline analysis must identify suspicious behavior
- [ ] **AC-024.7**: Device fingerprinting must be used for additional session validation
- [ ] **AC-024.8**: Velocity checks must detect impossible travel scenarios

### Security Response
- [ ] **AC-024.9**: Suspicious sessions must be flagged for additional verification
- [ ] **AC-024.10**: High-risk sessions must trigger immediate user notification
- [ ] **AC-024.11**: Session hijacking attempts must be logged via US-021 SecurityAuditLogger
- [ ] **AC-024.12**: Progressive security measures must be applied based on risk level

## Technical Requirements

### Session Security Validator
```java
@Component
public class SessionSecurityValidator {

    private final SecurityAuditLogger auditLogger; // From US-021
    private final SessionContextService sessionContextService;
    private final GeolocationService geolocationService;
    private final DeviceFingerprintService deviceFingerprintService;

    public Result<SessionSecurityAssessment> validateSessionSecurity(
            UpsertQuestionCommand command,
            HttpServletRequest request) {

        var sessionContext = sessionContextService.getSessionContext(command.getSessionId());
        var securityAssessment = new SessionSecurityAssessment();

        // 1. IP address consistency check
        var ipConsistency = validateIPConsistency(sessionContext, request);
        securityAssessment.addCheck("ip_consistency", ipConsistency);

        // 2. User-Agent string validation
        var userAgentConsistency = validateUserAgentConsistency(sessionContext, request);
        securityAssessment.addCheck("user_agent_consistency", userAgentConsistency);

        // 3. Geolocation analysis
        var geoLocationCheck = validateGeolocation(sessionContext, request);
        securityAssessment.addCheck("geolocation_analysis", geoLocationCheck);

        // 4. Concurrent session monitoring
        var concurrentSessionCheck = validateConcurrentSessions(command.getUserId());
        securityAssessment.addCheck("concurrent_sessions", concurrentSessionCheck);

        // 5. Device fingerprint validation
        var deviceCheck = validateDeviceFingerprint(sessionContext, request);
        securityAssessment.addCheck("device_fingerprint", deviceCheck);

        return processSecurityAssessment(securityAssessment, command);
    }
}
```

### Behavioral Analysis Engine
```java
public class SessionBehaviorAnalyzer {

    public BehaviorAnalysisResult analyzeSessionBehavior(
            Long userId,
            SessionContext currentSession,
            List<SessionActivity> recentActivity) {

        var analysis = new BehaviorAnalysisResult();

        // 1. Access pattern analysis
        analysis.addPattern("access_frequency", analyzeAccessFrequency(recentActivity));
        analysis.addPattern("access_timing", analyzeAccessTiming(recentActivity));
        analysis.addPattern("resource_pattern", analyzeResourceAccessPattern(recentActivity));

        // 2. Velocity analysis
        analysis.addVelocity("geographic_velocity", calculateGeographicVelocity(recentActivity));
        analysis.addVelocity("device_switching", analyzeDeviceSwitching(recentActivity));

        // 3. Anomaly detection
        analysis.addAnomaly("unusual_activity", detectUnusualActivity(userId, recentActivity));
        analysis.addAnomaly("impossible_travel", detectImpossibleTravel(recentActivity));

        return analysis;
    }
}
```

### Integration Points
- **US-021**: SecurityAuditLogger for session security event logging
- **US-020**: SecurityContextValidator for coordinated security validation
- **US-022**: PathParameterManipulationDetector for comprehensive threat detection

## Business Rules

### Session Security Rules
1. **IP Consistency**: Same session should generally use consistent IP addresses
2. **User-Agent Stability**: User-Agent strings should remain stable within sessions
3. **Geographic Reasonability**: Geographic location changes should be physically possible
4. **Concurrent Limits**: Users should have reasonable limits on concurrent sessions
5. **Device Consistency**: Device fingerprints should remain consistent within sessions

### Risk Assessment Levels
- **LOW RISK**: All consistency checks pass, normal behavioral patterns
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Minor inconsistencies, unusual but possible patterns
- **HIGH RISK**: Major inconsistencies, suspicious behavioral patterns
- **CRITICAL RISK**: Multiple red flags, likely session hijacking attempt

### Response Actions by Risk Level
- **LOW**: Continue normal processing, standard logging
- **MEDIUM**: Additional logging, continue processing with monitoring
- **HIGH**: Flag for additional verification, enhanced logging
- **CRITICAL**: Block request, immediate user notification, full investigation
