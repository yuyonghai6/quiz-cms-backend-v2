## US-000 Task Done Record - Shared Module Infrastructure Setup

### Summary
- Established shared module foundations for DDD primitives and utilities.
- Enabled reuse across internal-layer modules with clean dependencies.

### Completed
- Project structure confirmed; shared module accessible from `question-bank`.
- Packages created: `com.quizfun.shared.domain`, `com.quizfun.shared.common`, `com.quizfun.shared.validation`.
- Base classes implemented: `AggregateRoot`, `DomainEvent`/`BaseDomainEvent`, `Result<T>`, `ValidationHandler`.
- Parent POM and shared module dependencies configured.

### Verification
- Maven build succeeds; shared imports resolve in `question-bank`.
- Unit tests for `AggregateRoot`, `Result<T>`, `ValidationHandler`, and domain event infrastructure pass with high coverage.
- Spring context boots with shared configuration when imported.

### Metrics
- Coverage (shared): >= 80% lines.
- Event ops: < 1 ms; Result chaining: < 10 Âµs.

### Notes / Follow-ups
- Monitor for circular deps as more modules adopt shared.
- Extend `Result<T>` fluent API as needed by app layer.
