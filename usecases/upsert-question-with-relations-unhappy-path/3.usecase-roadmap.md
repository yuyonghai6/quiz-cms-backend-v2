# Use Case Roadmap - Upsert Question Unhappy Path Implementation

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the existing question upsert system (US-003 through US-007) with security protection and user-friendly error messaging. The implementation builds upon completed user stories and focuses on two critical areas:

1. **Security Breach Risk Mitigation**: Protecting against unauthorized access to question banks
2. **Enhanced Error Messaging**: Providing clear, actionable guidance for validation failures

**Total Implementation Timeline**: 4 weeks (Reduced from original 6 weeks based on existing foundation)
**Priority Level**: HIGH (Security) / MEDIUM (Error Messaging)
**Business Impact**: Critical for production readiness and improved developer experience
**Foundation**: Builds upon US-003 (Validation Chain), US-004 (Strategy Pattern), US-005 (Repository Layer), US-007 (Application Service)
