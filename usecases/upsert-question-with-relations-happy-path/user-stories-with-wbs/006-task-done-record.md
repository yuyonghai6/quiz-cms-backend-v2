  🎉 US-006: Supporting Aggregates Implementation - COMPLETE!

  ✅ Summary of Achievements

  Following TDD methodology, I have successfully implemented all three supporting domain aggregates for the
  upsert-question-with-taxonomies use case:

  🏗️ Core Implementations

  1. TaxonomySetAggregate - Complete validation logic
  - ✅ Validates taxonomy references against user's taxonomy set
  - ✅ Category hierarchy validation (prevents gaps like Level3 without Level2)
  - ✅ Efficient bulk and single taxonomy reference validation
  - ✅ User and question bank isolation enforcement

  2. QuestionTaxonomyRelationshipAggregate - Enhanced with factory method
  - ✅ Static factory method createFromCommand() for bulk relationship creation
  - ✅ Supports all relationship types: category_level_1-4, tag, quiz, difficulty_level
  - ✅ Relationship type validation and ownership controls
  - ✅ Integration with existing UpsertQuestionCommand workflow

  3. QuestionBanksPerUserAggregate - Ownership validation
  - ✅ Validates user ownership of active question banks
  - ✅ Default question bank identification
  - ✅ Embedded question bank array structure matching MongoDB schema
  - ✅ Active question bank filtering

  📦 Supporting Infrastructure

  Value Objects Created:
  - ✅ CategoryLevels with hierarchy validation
  - ✅ Tag, Quiz, DifficultyLevel, QuestionBank - immutable domain objects

  Repository Interfaces (already existed):
  - ✅ TaxonomySetRepository - comprehensive validation methods
  - ✅ QuestionBanksPerUserRepository - ownership operations

  🧪 Comprehensive Testing

  Test Coverage:
  - ✅ 28 unit tests across 3 new aggregate test classes
  - ✅ 5 integration tests for cross-aggregate workflows
  - ✅ All tests follow proper Allure annotations with Epic/Story structure
  - ✅ Tests use Testcontainers MongoDB (no localhost:27017 dependencies)

  Test Categories:
  - Taxonomy reference validation (valid/invalid scenarios)
  - Category hierarchy validation rules
  - User and question bank isolation
  - Relationship creation from commands
  - Cross-aggregate integration workflows

  📚 Documentation Updated

  - ✅ Enhanced data-modeling/question_bank_data_modeling_v3.md
  - ✅ Added comprehensive domain layer section
  - ✅ Documented all aggregates, value objects, and business rules
  - ✅ Integration patterns with existing CQRS mediator

  🎯 Key Business Rules Enforced

  1. Taxonomy Validation: All taxonomy references must exist in user's taxonomy set
  2. Category Hierarchy: No gaps allowed in category levels (Level 2 requires Level 1)
  3. User Isolation: All operations strictly enforce user and question bank boundaries
  4. Relationship Integrity: One relationship aggregate per taxonomy element
  5. Ownership Control: Only active question banks are considered valid

  🔌 Integration Points

  - ✅ Seamless integration with existing UpsertQuestionCommand
  - ✅ Compatible with CQRS mediator pattern and Result<T> error handling
  - ✅ Works with existing validation chains and repository patterns
  - ✅ Maintains consistency with current MongoDB schema design

  All supporting aggregates are now ready to enable robust taxonomy validation and relationship management for the question upsert 
  workflow! 🚀
