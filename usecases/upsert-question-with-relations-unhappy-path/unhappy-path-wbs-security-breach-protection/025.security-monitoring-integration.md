# US-025: Security Monitoring Integration

## User Story
**As a** security operations center (SOC) analyst
**I want** real-time security event monitoring and automated threat response integration
**So that** security incidents can be detected, analyzed, and responded to immediately

## Epic
Security Breach Protection

## Story
Implement comprehensive security monitoring integration with event publishing, alerting, and automated response systems

## Acceptance Criteria

### Event Publishing Pipeline
- [ ] **AC-025.1**: All security events from US-020 through US-024 must be published to monitoring systems
- [ ] **AC-025.2**: Event publishing must be asynchronous to avoid impacting request processing
- [ ] **AC-025.3**: Security events must be enriched with contextual metadata for analysis
- [ ] **AC-025.4**: Event publishing must include circuit breaker pattern for resilience

### Real-Time Alerting
- [ ] **AC-025.5**: Critical security events must trigger immediate alerts within 30 seconds
- [ ] **AC-025.6**: Alert routing must be based on event severity and type classification
- [ ] **AC-025.7**: Alert aggregation must prevent notification spam from similar events
- [ ] **AC-025.8**: Escalation procedures must be automated for unacknowledged critical alerts

### Security Dashboard Integration
- [ ] **AC-025.9**: Security events must be visualized in real-time security dashboard
- [ ] **AC-025.10**: Trend analysis and pattern recognition must be available for security analysts
- [ ] **AC-025.11**: Incident investigation tools must have access to correlated event data
- [ ] **AC-025.12**: Security metrics must be collected and reported for compliance

### Automated Response System

- [ ] **AC-025.15**: Account blocking must be available for confirmed malicious activity
- [ ] **AC-025.16**: Automated response actions must be logged and reversible

## Technical Requirements

### Security Event Publisher
```java
@Component
public class SecurityEventPublisher {

    private final ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher;
    private final SecurityEventEnricher eventEnricher;
    private final MonitoringSystemClient monitoringClient;
    private final AlertingService alertingService;
    private final CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker;

    @Async
    @EventListener
    public void publishSecurityEvent(SecurityEvent event) {
        try {
            // 1. Enrich event with contextual metadata
            var enrichedEvent = eventEnricher.enrichEvent(event);

            // 2. Publish to monitoring systems
            circuitBreaker.execute(() -> {
                monitoringClient.publishEvent(enrichedEvent);
                return null;
            });

            // 3. Trigger alerts for critical events
            if (event.getSeverity() == SeverityLevel.CRITICAL) {
                alertingService.triggerImmediateAlert(enrichedEvent);
            }

            // 4. Apply automated responses
            if (shouldTriggerAutomatedResponse(enrichedEvent)) {
                automatedResponseService.executeResponse(enrichedEvent);
            }

        } catch (Exception ex) {
            // Log failure but don't impact request processing
            log.error("Failed to publish security event: {}", event, ex);
        }
    }
}
```

### Security Monitoring Dashboard
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/security/monitoring")
public class SecurityMonitoringController {

    private final SecurityEventQueryService eventQueryService;
    private final SecurityMetricsService metricsService;
    private final ThreatAnalysisService threatAnalysisService;

    @GetMapping("/events/realtime")
    public SseEmitter streamSecurityEvents() {
        // Real-time security event streaming for dashboard
    }

    @GetMapping("/metrics/summary")
    public SecurityMetricsSummary getSecurityMetrics(
            @RequestParam LocalDateTime from,
            @RequestParam LocalDateTime to) {
        return metricsService.getSecurityMetricsSummary(from, to);
    }

    @GetMapping("/threats/analysis")
    public ThreatAnalysisReport analyzeThreatPatterns(
            @RequestParam String timeframe) {
        return threatAnalysisService.analyzeThreatPatterns(timeframe);
    }
}
```

### Automated Response System
```java
@Component
public class AutomatedSecurityResponseService {

    private final RateLimitingService rateLimitingService;
    private final AccountSecurityService accountSecurityService;
    private final SecurityAuditLogger auditLogger; // From US-021

    public void executeResponse(EnrichedSecurityEvent event) {
        var responseActions = determineResponseActions(event);

        for (var action : responseActions) {
            executeResponseAction(action, event);
            auditLogger.logAutomatedResponse(action, event);
        }
    }

    private void executeResponseAction(SecurityResponseAction action, EnrichedSecurityEvent event) {
        switch (action.getType()) {
            case RATE_LIMIT_USER:
                rateLimitingService.applyProgressiveLimit(event.getUserId(), action.getDuration());
                break;
            case BLOCK_IP_ADDRESS:
                rateLimitingService.blockIpAddress(event.getClientIp(), action.getDuration());
                break;
            case FLAG_ACCOUNT:
                accountSecurityService.flagAccountForReview(event.getUserId(), action.getReason());
                break;
            case REQUIRE_ADDITIONAL_AUTH:
                accountSecurityService.requireAdditionalAuthentication(event.getUserId());
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

### Integration Points
- **US-021**: SecurityAuditLogger provides security events to publish
- **US-020-024**: All security validators generate events for monitoring
- **External**: SIEM systems, alerting platforms, security dashboards

## Business Rules

### Event Publishing Rules
1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Security event publishing never blocks user requests
2. **Reliability**: Circuit breaker prevents monitoring system failures from affecting operations
3. **Enrichment**: Events include full context for effective analysis and response
4. **Retention**: Published events retained according to compliance requirements

### Alerting Rules
1. **Severity-Based**: Alert routing and urgency based on event severity levels
2. **Aggregation**: Similar events aggregated to prevent alert fatigue
3. **Escalation**: Unacknowledged critical alerts escalated automatically
4. **Context**: Alerts include sufficient context for immediate triage

### Automated Response Rules
1. **Proportional**: Automated responses proportional to threat severity
2. **Reversible**: All automated actions can be reviewed and reversed
3. **Logged**: All automated responses fully logged for audit and analysis
4. **Progressive**: Increasing severity of responses for repeated violations
